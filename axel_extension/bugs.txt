Current State:
    Functional password storage capabilities



Major bugs      //affect functionality on large scale


Minor bugs      //small front end issues that don't affect interaction

1.  What is happening   
        -   if you click the admin mode button within admin mode, you're asked to create password
        -   this is probably because that is the default for clicking on admin mode
            how to make admin mode not clickable when in admin mode. occurred once event.preventDefault added

2.  What is happening
        -   if you're within the password phase, click outside of the text area box, and
            hit enter, the submit button doesn't register the enter hit



 Potential User stories
 When in admin mode, want to stay in admin mode when exiting GUI (potential user story)
    -   either make the extension run in the background OR make two cases of admin and child mode stories
        child mode isnt default
